# employee-data-to-Nested-Dictionar

This repository contains a Python script that constructs a dictionary from the data provided in the `data.txt` file. The resulting dictionary maps each employer to a list of employee dictionaries, each containing information about the employee's department, email, IP address, and password.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the `exercise.py` script.

2. Ensure the `data.txt` file is in the same directory as the `exercise.py` script. The `data.txt` file should contain the employee data in the following format:

```
first_name    last_name    email                 password    ip_address       department                employer
Abba          Ingon        aingonrg@unicef.org   xGtrxwp6wz  152.32.158.61   Business Development     Netflix
Abbie         Rain         arain8n@ucoz.ru       y5i3gYnIE4jz 252.37.99.79    Training                 Facebook
...
```

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script and the `data.txt` file.

4. Run the Python script using the following command:

```
python exercise.py
```

5. The script will process the data and create a dictionary based on the employer-employee relationships. The output will be displayed on the terminal.

6. Additionally, the script will write the formatted dictionary to the `output.txt` file in the same directory.

7. You can validate the output by generating an MD5 hash of the `output.txt` file. The expected hash value is provided in the comments of the script.

## Example Output

Here is a shortened version of the output dictionary generated by the script:

```
{
    'Amazon': [
        {
            'Adams Comellini': {
                'department': 'Support',
                'email': 'acomellinin7@dailymotion.com',
                'ip_addr': '220.234.157.81',
                'password': 'Y9zK7Q'
            }
        },
        {
            'Adelheid Hedworth': {
                'department': 'Sales',
                'email': 'ahedworthpb@eepurl.com',
                'ip_addr': '78.141.170.80',
                'password': 'L1zEWvCYnB'
            }
        },
        ...
    ],
    'Facebook': [
        {
            'Abbie Rain': {
                'department': 'Training',
                'email': 'arain8n@ucoz.ru',
                'ip_addr': '252.37.99.79',
                'password': 'y5i3gYnIE4jz'
            }
        },
        {
            'Abbie McWilliams': {
                'department': 'Legal',
                'email': 'amcwilliamscr@nsw.gov.au',
                'ip_addr': '110.79.254.53',
                'password': 'CA3xa5Yj4R'
            }
        },
        ...
    ],
    ...
}
```

Please note that the full output will contain all the employer-employee relationships provided in the `data.txt` file.
